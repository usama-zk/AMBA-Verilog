In our project, we implemented the AMBA bus by designing an APB controller that manages transactions between a master device and various peripheral devices. This involved creating a simplified APB protocol interface and integrating it with the master and peripheral components. The system was then implemented on an FPGA, ensuring efficient communication and low power consumption within the SoC. Our GitHub repository contains the Verilog code and testbenches for understanding the design.
